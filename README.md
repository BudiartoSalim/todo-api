# todo-api
Simple todo API for nextjs todo app practice, created using Typescript and Express, with PostgreSQL Database.

Project setup and testing express with TS done, next is to decide on how to do the database.

ORM still undecided, will probably use Sequelize or no ORM at all, or trying TypeORM.

Currently leaning towards no ORM but will probably decide tomorrow.
